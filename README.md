# Python libraries

## General

1. [black](https://pypi.org/project/black/): Neat code formatter - `black my_file.py`. There is a jupyter notebooks alternative - [nb_black](https://pypi.org/project/nb-black/) with as well. Enable it with `%load_ext nb_black` in your notebook and disable it with `%load_ext lab_black`.
2. [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) A tool which performs formatting and makes checks such as pep8. Used in CI.
3. [dask](https://www.dask.org/) My favorite parallel computing lib in Python.

## Viz
1. [matplotlib-venn](https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib-venn/) I use it to make Venn diagrams.

## ML

1. [automl](https://pypi.org/project/automl/) A tool to quickly test various models on your data. A brute forse, which saves a lot of time and should be used with caution.
