1. [Google Project Management Professional Certification](https://coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-project-management?) - 6 course specialization via Coursera.
   > I took the course at a time when my work was project-based within a limited team.
   >  I needed to hear best practices to improve project documentation and get the basics of agile.
   > I loved the Agile course (4/6) the most. While the majority of the content is *common sense*,
   > it is neatly presented and managed to structure better what I already knew and was doing intuitively in my head.
   > The specialization counts for preparational educational hours for the PMP and CAPM certification by the [PMI institute](https://www.pmi.org/certifications).

2. [Generative AI with Large Language Models](https://www.coursera.org/learn/generative-ai-with-llms) offered by deeplearning.ai via Coursera.
   > This course is offered via the top names [Antje](https://www.linkedin.com/in/antje-barth/),
   > [Shelbee](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shelbee-eigenbrode-5b632414/), [Mike](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikegchambers/) et. al.
   > It is meant for people already familiar with ML and DL to some extent. It is not a "prompt engineering" course; it goes through
   > all the steps to build an LLM and explains the LLM architecture on a high but still deep enough level. The course can be completed even
   > within a day and is worthwhile as an introduction to LLMs for coding, DS, or ML people.
